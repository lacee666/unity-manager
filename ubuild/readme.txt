There are 4 types of buildings:
1. farm - it generates gold and can upgrade up to lvl4 and gives +1 capacity
2. tower - it attacks enemies and can upgrade up to lvl4
3. lumbermill - it generates wood and can upgrade up to lvl4
4. barracks - it can spawn soldiers, soldiers will try to find enemies and attack them. They cost lumber. 1 soldier -> 1 capacity
You can upgrade, research buildings by clicking on the picture on the lower bar. 
You can interact with buildings this way: 
right click-> upgrade or destroy 
tab or right click -> cancel 
Cheatcode: F3 -> +100 gold :)

After 20 seconds a new wave of skeletons spawn. They try to reach the capital hall and destroy it. After killing them, the timer is reset to 20 seconds and more skeletons will come, calculated by using this function ->f(x)=(2*x*x) where x is the x th wave.

but it only works in unity editor mode. Since I created this on my account and
can't create a new one(can't register again with the same phone number), it only works on my account, so only I can login.
